Posting news

You can add news in the admin interface now. Search for the label ``Aldryn_News``.

In order to display them, create a CMS page and install the app there (choose ``News`` from the ``Advanced Settings -> Application`` dropdown).

Now redeploy the site again.

The above CMS site has become a news archive view.


Available Plug-ins
==================

``Latest News Entries`` plugin lets you list **n** most frequent news filtered by tags.


Search
==================

If you want the news entries to be searchable, be sure to install ``aldryn-search`` and its dependencies.
Your entries will be searchable using ``django-haystack``.

You can turn it this behavior off by setting ``ALDRYN_NEWS_SEARCH = False`` in your django settings.
